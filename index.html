      <h2>Simpson Says!</h2>
    
      <p>Ho: There's a $10,000 bill in it for you. Barney: Oh yeah? Which president is on it? Homer: Um, all of them. They are having a party. Jimmy Carter is passed out on the couch. Homer: Hey boy. Wanna play catch? Bart: No thanks dad. Homer: When a son doesn't want to play catch with his father something is definitely wrong. Grampa: I'll play catch with you. Homer: Go home. Dr. Hibbert: We don't believe fur is murder, but paying for it sure is.</p>

      <p> Homer: Olive oil? Asparagus? If your mother wasn't so fancy, we could just shop at the gas station like normal people. Cartoonist: Excuse me, but "proactive" and "paradigm"? Aren't these just buzzwords that dumb people use to sound important? [backpedaling] Cartoonist: Not that I'm accusing you of anything like that. [pause] Cartoonist: I'm fired, aren't I?</p>
    
      <p>Mr. Burns: I love children, particularly their young supple organs. Homer: Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Marge: Homer, why aren't you at work? You're late. Homer: They said if I came in late again that I would get fired, and I can't risk that, so I'm not going. Homer: Ooh, it's been St. Patrick's Day for hours, and I'm still not drunk yet.</p>

        <p>Marge: You should probably see a doctor about this... Homer: OK. Marge: [realizing] A competent doctor. Homer: D'oh! Apu: Here at the Kwik-E-Mart we believe in America. Please do not beat me up anymore. Homer: Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.</p>
      
        <p>Moe: Bring us your finest food, stuffed with your second-finest. Waiter: Very well, the lobster stuffed with tacos.</p>
